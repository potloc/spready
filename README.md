## A bit of context

At Potloc we like it when our code is easy to read, write and self-explanatory. One thing we often do is to use the spread operator, but sometimes based on certain condition we do not want to execute a specif spread operation. There are multiple ways to achive this, but none are "easy to read, write and self-explanatory". Here are some examples:

### conditional assignment using a if block

The example below is easy to read and write, but might not be as self-explanatory because of the usaged Object.assign. Also where is the the famous spread operator that we has developpers love?

```ts
function buildConfig(host: string, isSecure: boolean) {
  const config = { host, ssl: false, protocol: "http" };

  if (isSecure) {
    Object.assign(config, { ssl: true, protocol: "https" });
  }

  return config;
}
```

### Inline conditional spread using the conditional operator

The example below is not easy to read, write or even self-explanatory. It looks likes someones is trying to be a bit too smart, but at least it uses our beloved spread operator!

```ts
const buildConfig = (host: string, isSecure: boolean) => ({
  host,
  ssl: false,
  protocol: "http",
  ...(isSecure ? { ssl: true, protocol: "https" } : {}),
});
```

### Then, what?!

Since we are developpers, we've decided to write a small piece of code to make the conditionnal spread easy to read, write and self-explanatory. Boom üí• spready was born! Here is the same example using it.

```ts
import spready from "@potloc/spready";

const buildConfig = (host: string, isSecure: boolean) => ({
  host,
  ssl: false,
  protocol: "http",
  ...spready({ ssl: true, protocol: "https" }).if(isSecure),
});
```

## Getting Started üöÄ

Install `@potloc/spready` using the package manager of your chose, import it and start using it!

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @potloc/spready
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @potloc/spready
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @potloc/spready
```

## Usage

### With `if` method

It returns the object passed in parameter if the condition is thruty.

```ts
import spready from "@potloc/spready";

// { foo: "bar", baz: "qux" }
const a = {
  foo: "bar",
  ...spready({ baz: "qux" }).if(true),
};

// { foo: "bar" }
const b = {
  foo: "bar",
  ...spready({ baz: "qux" }).if(false),
};
```

### With `unless` method

It returns the object passed in parameter if the condition is falsy.

```ts
import spready from "@potloc/spready";

// { foo: "bar" }
const a = {
  foo: "bar",
  ...spready({ baz: "qux" }).unless(true),
};

// { foo: "bar", baz: "qux" }
const b = {
  foo: "bar",
  ...spready({ baz: "qux" }).unless(false),
};
```

### With a callback

It can also conditionally invoke code if we pass a callback in parameter.

```ts
import spready from "@potloc/spready";

// it will also log "Hello World!"
// { foo: "bar", baz: "qux" }
const a = {
  foo: "bar",
  ...spready(() => {
    console.log("Hello World!");

    return { baz: "qux" };
  }).if(true),
};

// it won't log "Hello World!"
// { foo: "bar" }
const b = {
  foo: "bar",
  ...spready(() => {
    console.log("Hello World!");

    return { baz: "qux" };
  }).if(false),
};
```

### JSX example

It can increase the readability of your JSX code.

```tsx
import spready from "@potloc/spready";

const SumitButton = (props) => {
  const { isSubmitting } = props;

  return (
    <button
      type="submit"
      disabled={isSubmitting}
      {...spready({ className: "is-loading" }).if(isSubmitting)}
    >
      Submit
    </button>
  );
};
```
